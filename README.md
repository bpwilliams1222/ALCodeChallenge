# ALCodeChallenge
This is an application that pulls in data leveraging Stackoverflow's API. It pulls in questions with accepted answers where there are more than one answer option to a given question. This data will be provided to users through an interactive game-like experience where they can choose from a list of answers to a question in attempts to choose correctly versus what was accepted within Stackoverflow. Good luck!
